# A Novel Machine Learning Framework-based Rapid Screening of Ionizable Lipids in LNPs for Highly-efficient mRNA Expression

## Dataset
The 'dataset' folder contains both the raw dataset we collected and the molecular descriptor dataset used to construct the model.

## Usage
The LipidAI framework necessitates several training iterations, each comprising a base-learner training period, ensemble stacking, and feature selection. To facilitate tracking, we label the code with a serial number before naming it. The initial iteration of the training process is exemplified in the ‘base_model_training’ and ‘model_refinement’ folders. Furthermore, the final trained model is available in the ‘models’ folder.
